# JATE-HW19

## Description 
---
Aside from being the Week 19 Challenge, this single-paged text editor functions in the browser, meeting basic PWA requirements. The files and code follow the client-server model, and this app can function offline.

## Installation
---
The following commands will need to be run in the user's terminal, with the exception of the last one, which is a program:

1) npm i --> to download necessary modules in the root, client, and server folders respectively

2) npm start --> run local server

The following packages were used: Express, Concurrently, Nodemon, and webpack (with a number of plugins/dependencies).

## Heroku Deployment
---
The app can be accessed through the Heroku link below:
https://morning-escarpment-25399.herokuapp.com/.

## Usage 
---
In theory, a user can record a number of notes and thoughts with or without access to the internet.

## Credits
---
Aside from my instructor and T.A., much of the code and information stemmed from the bootcamp activities for Week 19.
